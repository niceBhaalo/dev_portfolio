Welcome to my portfolio project. 

Update Date 19 August 2024

Sets up four Docker Containers for Front End, Back End, MongoDB, and MongoExpress.
Using the docker compose up you can start all of the four servers simultaneously and start working. 

No intentional and good documentation added in code for now. 

Uses a whole bunch of stuff from React, Mongo, Node, Express, SASS, and more.
